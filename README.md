<h2>About</h2>

As all we know, Xiaomi Mi A2 LITE only has one speaker at the bottom, thats why the sound output is quite underwhelmed when compare to other latest flagships from HTC or even Apple iPhone 7 which using its earpiece speaker as secondary output

Coming from that concept, this mod will allow you to use your earpiece as second speaker as well, creating pseudo-stereo output in result and should give better experience inplaying any audio
